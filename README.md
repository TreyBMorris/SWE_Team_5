# Blazor-Server API Testing

## About
This is a Blazor Server .NET7 project where I am implementing different features for a bigger project that I am apart of for SWE 3313.
I am using a CosmosDB hosted on Microsoft Azure and using Azure functions to server as my API. There are various small features that I am working on to add to an overall E-Commerce like platform.

### Current features
- Blazor Server to reads from an Azure Serverless API using CosmosDB to return information from the API to the Table. 
- Can Generate and Download CSV File to local
- Registration Page that does an HTTP POST request to the Azure hosted database to store "user information".
### Work in progress features
- Authentication and Authorization
- Login Page that reads user information stored in the database
