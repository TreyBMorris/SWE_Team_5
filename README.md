-  Environment Requirements: To run the application you need Visual Studio 22 Community Edition, or any other version of Visual Studio 22. For Visual Studio 22, you need a Windows or a MacOS device since Linux does not have any working version of Visual Studio 22.

- Cloning and Building the Application on a Fresh Machine
  - In the repository, at the top of the page click the green button labeled "Code"
  - After clicking the "Code" button, you will want to click "HTTPS" and copy the link provided ending in ".git"
  - Launch Visual Studio 22 on your local machine.
  - In Visual Studio, there will be a section on the right-hand side labeled "Get started"
  - Under "Get started" click "Clone a repository"
  - Under "Repository location" you will paste the link that you previously copied from GitHub, then click Clone.
  - You will then want to click "ServerAPI.sln"
  - You will then want to click the green play button that says "https", this will load the application into your commonly used browser.
 
- Common Issues that may occur
  - When first loading the application into your browser, certain browsers will originally deny you access to the page. You will need to "accept risk" and proceed which will lead you into the application.
  - There will also be some instances where the APIs will be a little slow connecting and receiving data from the databases. This can cause issues like the item pages not instantly loading or the login feature not working quickly. If this happens, you will need to wait and then refresh and this fixes the issue.
