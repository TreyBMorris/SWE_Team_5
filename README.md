# ServerAPI
## About
This is a Blazor Server .NET7 project where I am implementing different features for a bigger project that I am apart of for a class. The goal is to have a NoSQL Database hosted on Microsoft Azure to have an API to connect to my Blazor Server program where it will display data to a table. A few smaller goals include adding authorization and authentication for users and admins to have access to different pages within the app, and having a admin page that can generate and export a CSV file, which is the information from the database.

### Current features
- Blazor Server to reads from an Azure Serverless API using CosmosDB to return information from the API to the Table. 
- Can Generate and Download CSV File to local
### Work in progress features
- Authentication and Authorization
